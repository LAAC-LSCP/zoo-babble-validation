- set to knit to word
- tab-LENA-challenge comment out:
#%>%
#add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Recall"= 3, "Label Frequency" = 2))

Then in the docx created:
- bring up author note so it's on first page
- bold & center abstract
- bold & center title on p. 3
- add the two tables
- add the 5 figures
- add line numbers
-
